/** Reliable Data Transport class.
 *
 *  This class implements a reliable data transport service.
 *  It uses a sliding window protocol, on a packet basis,
 *  with selective repeat.
 *
 *  An application layer thread provides new packet payloads to be
 *  sent using the provided send() method, and retrieves newly arrived
 *  payloads with the receive() method. Each application layer payload
 *  is sent as a separate UDP packet, along with a sequence number and
 *  a type flag that identifies a packet as a data packet or an
 *  acknowledgment. The sequence numbers are 15 bits.
